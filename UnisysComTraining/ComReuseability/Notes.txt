For Creating COM objects in C++ U should follow the following steps:
1. Create the IDL file
2. Implement the COM interfaces in a COM Component
3. Implement a class Factory and instantiate COm object in the CreateInstance
4. Provide the implementation of the EXPORT Functions of COM.
5. Create the Module Defn file for the functions that U R exporting...
6. Register the COM Component if U have not implemented DllRegisterServer.
